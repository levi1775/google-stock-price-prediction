# Google Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

![Stock Prediction](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Stock_Market_Board.png)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict Google stock price trends using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, specifically **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. The model is trained on historical stock price data from **2012 to 2016** and tested on **January 2017** data. The goal is not to predict exact prices but to capture upward and downward trends.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset consists of Google stock prices:
- **Training Data**: Google stock prices from **2012 to 2016**.
- **Test Data**: Google stock prices for **January 2017**.
- Both datasets contain the **opening price** of each trading day.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Architecture
The implemented model is a **stacked LSTM** network with multiple layers to capture complex patterns in stock price movements.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization using `MinMaxScaler`.
- **Stacked LSTM**: Four LSTM layers with **50 units each**.
- **Dropout Regularization**: To prevent overfitting.
- **Adam Optimizer**: For efficient training.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Prediction & Visualization**: Comparison between actual and predicted stock prices.

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Setup
### Dependencies:
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib keras scikit-learn
